The  moss beds are splendid at sunset and the Lotus Eaters nearby are pacified.  Just play some volleyball and relax.  The same can't be said to the North - the glass Pyramids and Stilt Village are shown as friendly on the recon slides, but then what shot down a cutter that way a few cycles back?  Something's brewing and the invaders can be behind every slime mold, invisible in spider holes beneath the moss or infiltrating the pacified villages, concealled by thier crudely potent magics.
